Step-by-Step Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the simple-HRNet repository from GitHub using the following command:


git clone https://github.com/username/simple-HRNet.git
cd simple-HRNet
Replace https://github.com/username/simple-HRNet.git with the actual URL of the simple-HRNet repository.

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project. This keeps your dependencies organized and avoids conflicts with other projects. You can use venv or conda for this. Here's how to do it with venv:


python -m venv hrnet-env
source hrnet-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `hrnet-env\Scripts\activate`

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Inside the repository, install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install all the necessary Python packages listed in requirements.txt.

Step 4: Additional Dependencies
Depending on your use case, you may need to install additional dependencies. For example, if you're planning to use real-time webcam functionalities, you might need to install opencv-python:


pip install opencv-python
Step 5: Verify Installation
To verify that simple-HRNet has been installed correctly, you can run a quick test by executing one of the sample scripts provided in the repository.


python scripts/run_simple_hrnet.py
Replace run_simple_hrnet.py with the appropriate script name. This should run the script and output the results, indicating a successful installation.
